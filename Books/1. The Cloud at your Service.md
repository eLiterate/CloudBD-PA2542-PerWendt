## Chapter 1: What is Cloud Computing
### The Chapter covers:
* Defining the 5 main principples of cloud computing
* Benefiting from moving to the cloud
* How evolving IT led to cloud computing
* Discussing different layers (types) of clouds

### Five main principles of Cloud Computing
* Pooles ocmputing resources available to any subscribing users
* Virtualized computing resources to maximize hardware utilization
* Elastic scaling up or down according to need
* Automated creating of new virtual machines or deletion of existing ones
* Resource usage billed only as used

### 1: Pooles computing resources
CAPEX Capital Expenses
OPEX Opretional Expenses

_Own data center_
* $$$ CAPEX
* $$$ OPEX

_Colocation_
* $$ CAPEX
* $$ OPEX

_Managed hosting_
* 0 CAPEX
* $$$ OPEX

_Cloud Computing_
* 0 CAPEX
* $$ OPEX

### 2: Virtulized computing resources to maximize hardware utilization
The recent technological breakthrough that enabled high utilization on commodity hardware — and which is the single biggest factor behind the cloud being a recent IT phenomenon — is virtualization where each physical server is partitioned into many virtual servers.

### 3: Elastic Scaling Up or Down According to Need
Elasticity - a synomny for dynamically scaling - refers to the ability to not only perform adequately under baseline load conditions, but also to handle peak load scenarious. When self-hosting, you need to over-provisioning.

### 4: Automated creatig of new virtual machines or deletion of existing ones
A cloud-deployed application can provision new instances on an as-needed basis, and these resources are brought online within minutes. After the peak demand ebbs, and you don’t need the additional resources, these virtual instances can be taken offline and de-provisioned, and you will no longer be billed. Your incremental cost is only for the hours that those additional instances were in use and active. 

### 5: Resource usage billed only as used
The cloud is a pay-as-you-go-model. You only pay for what you used. No annual contract, no commitment.

## Benefits Garned from Moving to the Cloud
* Economic benfits of the change from Capital to operational expenses
* Agilty benefits from not having to procure and provision servers
* efficiency benefits that may lead to competitive advantages
* Securityis stronger in the cloud

## Evolution of IT leading to Cloud Computing

### The Cloud Metaphor
Internet was drawed as a cloud...

### Major computing paradigm shifts: mainframes to client-server to web
* 1960 - 1980s: Time-sharing
* 1990s: Client-server
* 2000s: Grid and SaaS
* 2005+: The Cloud

### housing of physical computing reources: data center evolution
* Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Expedia, Amazon:  massive data centers

### Software componentization and remote access: SOA, Virtualization, and SaaS
* Virtualiaation
* SOA
